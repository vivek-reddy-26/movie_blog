                    Lucas and Moore wrote the script after executive producer Chris Bender's friend disappeared and had a large bill after being sent to a strip club. 
                    After Lucas and Moore sold it to the studio for $2 million, Phillips and Jeremy Garelick rewrote the script to include a tiger as well as a subplot involving a baby and a police cruiser, 
                    and also including boxer Mike Tyson. Filming took place in Nevada for 15 days, and during filming, the three main actors (Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis) formed a real friendship.

                    The film became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon and gained a cult following among young people. 
                    Following American Pie, the second and third films in the series, American Pie 2 (2001) and American Wedding (2003), were released;

                    Throughout the first film in the original series, Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs) tries to develop a relationship with his school classmate Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). 
                    Jim and three of his best friends, Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Chris Ostreicher (Chris Klein), make a pact to lose their virginity before their high school graduation. 
                    Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), the obnoxious jock of the group, provides them with unorthodox advice while hosting wild parties in the meantime.

                    Deadpool is a 2016 American superhero film directed by Tim Miller, in his directorial debut, and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and distributed by 20th Century Fox, 
                    it is a spin-off of the X-Men film series and its overall eighth installment. The film stars Ryan Reynolds in the title role, alongside Morena Baccarin, Ed Skrein, T. J. Miller, Gina Carano and Brianna Hildebrand, with a cameo by Stan Lee. 
                    In the film, Wade Wilson hunts the man responsible for giving him mutant abilities and a scarred physical appearance, becoming the antihero Deadpool.

                    <br>
                    Development of a Deadpool film starring Reynolds began in February 2004, before he played the character in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009). Reese and Wernick were hired for a spin-off in 2010 and worked with Reynolds to adapt the character more faithfully (including his fourth-wall breaking) 
                    after the portrayal in Wolverine was criticized. Miller was hired in 2011. An enthusiastic response to leaked test footage he created with Reynolds led to a greenlight from Fox in 2014. Additional casting began in early 2015, and principal photography took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from March to May of that year. 
                    Several vendors provided visual effects for the film, ranging from the addition of blood and gore to the creation of the CGI character Colossus.

                    <br>
                    Deadpool premiered at the Le Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, and was released in the United States on February 12, after an unconventional marketing campaign. The film achieved both financial and critical success.
                    It earned $782.8 million against a $58 million budget, becoming the ninth-highest grossing film of 2016 and breaking numerous records, including the highest-grossing film in the X-Men series and the highest-grossing R-rated film at the time. 
                    Critics praised Reynolds' performance, the film's style, faithfulness to the comics and action sequences, though some criticized the plot as formulaic and were divided on the film's adult humor. 
                    It received many awards and nominations, including two Critics' Choice awards and two Golden Globe nominations.

                    <br>
                    A sequel titled Deadpool 2 was released on May 2018 to comparable critical and commercial success. Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney, the character's film rights were returned to Marvel Studios alongside the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. 
                    Deadpool & Wolverine, a third film starring Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, which will integrate the characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is scheduled for release on July 26, 2024, as part of Phase Five of the MCU.
