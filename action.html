                          John Wick began a successful franchise which includes three sequels (John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), John Wick: Chapter 3 â€“ Parabellum (2019), and John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)), the prequel television series The Continental: From the World of John Wick (2023), the spin-off film John Wick Presents: Ballerina (2025),
                           as well as video games and comic books.
                          Some retrospective assessments have identified John Wick to be among the best action films made; it is seen as having revitalized the genre and popularized long single takes with choreographed, detailed action.
