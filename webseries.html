                Intended to be a feature-length film trilogy, the comic book series adaptation began its development in 2008, with Adam McKay set to direct the films. Due to creative differences between the crew and the studios that picked it up, the project was left in development hell. 
                Eventually, the development for The Boys was revived in 2016 by Cinemax, which announced that it would be reworked as a television series. Kripke was recruited to be the showrunner of the series, while Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg would be credited as executive producers. 
                Amazon Studios obtained the rights for the series in November 2017, with production starting in May 2018 in Toronto, Canada.

                In May 2024, the series was renewed for a fifth and final season. As part of a shared universe, a spin-off web series, Seven on 7, premiered on July 7, 2021, an animated anthology series, Diabolical, premiered on March 4, 2022,
