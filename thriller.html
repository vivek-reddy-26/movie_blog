                    Zodiac is a 2007 American mystery thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by James Vanderbilt, based on the nonfiction books by Robert Graysmith: Zodiac (1986) and Zodiac Unmasked (2002).
                    It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr., with Anthony Edwards, Brian Cox, Elias Koteas, Donal Logue, John Carroll Lynch, Chloë Sevigny, Philip Baker Hall, and Dermot Mulroney in supporting roles.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The film tells the story of the manhunt for the Zodiac Killer,
                    a serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area during the late 1960s and early 1970s, taunting police with letters, bloodstained clothing, and ciphers mailed to newspapers.
                    The case remains one of the United States' most infamous unsolved crimes. Fincher, Vanderbilt,
                    and producer Bradley J. Fischer spent 18 months conducting their own investigation and research into the Zodiac murders.
                    Fincher employed the digital Thomson Viper FilmStream Camera to photograph most of the film and used traditional high-speed film cameras for slow-motion murder sequences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Zodiac was released by Paramount Pictures in North America and by Warner Bros. Pictures in international markets on March 2, 2007. It received largely positive reviews,
                    with praise for its writing, directing, acting, and historical accuracy. The film was nominated for several awards, including the Saturn Award for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film.
                    It grossed over $84.7 million worldwide on a production budget of $65 million.
                    In a 2016 critics' poll conducted by the BBC, Zodiac was voted the 12th greatest film of the 21st century.

                    Oldboy is a 2003 South Korean action-thriller film directed and co-written by Park Chan-wook. 
                    A loose adaptation of the Japanese manga of the same name, the film follows the story of Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik),
                    who is imprisoned in a cell that resembles a hotel room for 15 years without knowing the identity of his captor or his captor's motives.
                    When he is finally released, Dae-su finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and violence as he seeks revenge against his enigmatic captor (Yoo Ji-tae). 
                    His quest becomes tied in with romance when he falls in love with a young sushi chef, Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung).

                    where it garnered high praise from Quentin Tarantino, the president of the jury. In the United States,
                    film critic Roger Ebert stated that Oldboy is a "powerful film not because of what it depicts, but because of the depths of the human heart which it strips bare". 
                    The film's action sequences, particularly the single shot corridor fight sequence, also received commendation for their impressive execution.

                    The film's success led to two adaptations: an unauthorized Hindi remake in 2006 and an official American adaptation in 2013.
                    As part of Park Chan-wook's The Vengeance Trilogy, it serves as the second installment, following Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and preceding Lady Vengeance (2005).

                    The film is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and has been included in numerous "best-of" lists by many publications.
                    In 2008, Oldboy was placed 64th on an Empire list of the top 500 movies of all time.
                    In 2020, The Guardian ranked it number 3 among the classics of modern South Korean Cinema.

                <pre>
                    Directed by	: Todd Phillips
                    Release date:October 4, 2019
                </pre>
                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;">
                    Joker is a 2019 American psychological thriller film directed and co-produced by Todd Phillips from a screenplay co-written with Scott Silver.
                    The film, loosely based on DC Comics characters, stars Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck,
                    a failed clown and aspiring stand-up comedian whose descent into mental illness and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City.
                    Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, and Frances Conroy appear in supporting roles. Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, Joker was produced by Warner Bros.
                    Pictures and DC Films in association with Village Roadshow Pictures, Bron Creative and Joint Effort.

                    <br>
                    Phillips conceived Joker in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of Martin Scorsese, particularly Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1982); 
                    Scorsese was initially attached to the project as a producer. The film loosely adapts plot elements from Batman: The Killing Joke (1988), and The Dark Knight Returns (1986), but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration, 
                    nor did he wish for it to be connected to any prior Batman film continuity. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. 
                    Principal photography took place in New York City, Jersey City and Newark, from September to December 2018. Joker is the first live-action theatrical Batman film to receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Joker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 4.
                    The film received polarizing reviews from critics, with praise directed toward Phillips's direction, the screenplay, Phoenix's performance, musical score, and cinematography,
                    while the dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, lack of originality and depiction of violence were more divisive. The film was a box office success and set records for an October release.
                    It grossed over $1 billion; the first R-rated film to do so and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019 during its theatrical run. The film also received numerous accolades. 
                    A sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is set to be released on October 4, 2024.

                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Seven_%28movie%29_poster.jpg" alt="SEVEN" class="centre">
                <pre>
                    Directed by	: David Fincher
                    Release date:September 22, 1995

                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;">
                    Seven (often stylized as Se7en) is a 1995 American crime thriller film directed by David Fincher and written by Andrew Kevin Walker. 
                    It stars Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, with Gwyneth Paltrow, and John C. McGinley in supporting roles. 
                    Set in an unnamed, crime-ridden city, Seven's narrative follows disenchanted, 
                    nearly retired detective William Somerset (Freeman) and his newly transferred partner David Mills (Pitt) 
                    as they try to stop a serial killer from committing a series of murders based on the seven deadly sins.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Walker, an aspiring writer, based Seven on his experiences of moving from a suburban setting to New York City
                    during a period of rising crime and drug addiction in the late 1980s. His script was optioned by an Italian film company but, following financial difficulties, the rights were sold to New Line Cinema. 
                    Studio executives were opposed to the script's bleak conclusion, insisting on a more mainstream and optimistic outcome.
                     Fincher, determined to re-establish himself after a career setback with his directorial debut Alien 3,
                      was mistakenly sent Walker's original script and, convinced of its merit, committed to directing the project if the original ending remained intact. 
                      Principal photography took place in Los Angeles between December 1994 and March 1995, on a $33–$34 million budget.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Seven garnered middling test audience results and was not predicted to perform well due to its violent and mature content. 
                    However, it grossed $327.3 million worldwide, becoming a surprise success and the seventh highest-grossing film of the year. 
                    Contemporaneous reviews were generally positive, praising the performances of the central cast and the ending.
                    Seven revitalized Fincher's career and helped Pitt move from roles based on his appearance to more serious, dramatic roles.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the years since its release, consensus on the movie has generally shifted to critical acclaim. 
                    It has been influential in filmmaking, inspiring many imitators of its aesthetic, style, soundtrack, 
                    and premise of detectives investigating serial killers with distinctive methods and motives. 
                    The film's title sequence, which depicts the killer preparing for his actions later in the film, 
                    is considered an important design innovation that sparked a renewed interest in title design,
                     while the film's twist ending has been named as one of the most shocking and unforgettable in cinematic history.
